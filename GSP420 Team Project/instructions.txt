Welcome to Run, Man, Run!
This is an infinite runner game: You gain points by surviving.
The longer you live, the more points you get.

If you fall into a pit or hit a wall, you lose!
If you come across a pile of junk, you have to dash to break through it, or else you will lose.

Press X or the Right Mosue Button to Jump.
Hold down Jump to jump higher; release it quickly to jump lower.

Press Z or the Left Mouse Button to Dash.
There is a short delay before you can dash again.
You can dash while airborne, but you'll need to land before you can dash again.

Survive as long as you can and try to beat the high score!
