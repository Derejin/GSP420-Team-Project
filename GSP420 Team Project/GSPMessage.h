//to act as a basis for a simple Messaging system
//this messaging system may be replaced later if we need to integrate with the
//GSP420 project

//this file contains the GSPMessage struct and an enum list of potential recipients

//to mark this as a file that may need changing if the messaging system is changed,
//here's the menu change symbol: ~_~m

#pragma once

//enum RClass (recipient class) - contains list of recipients!
enum RClass
{
	RNONE, //no recipient
  RGPMENU, //gameplay scene buttons
	RGPSCENE, //gameplay scene reciever
  RTITLEMENU, //title scene buttons
	RTITLESCENE //title scene reciever
};

//GSPMessage structure!
struct GSPMessage
{
	RClass Recipient; //desired recipient!

	int theMessage; //message value that will be performed

	//default constructor! just null values
	GSPMessage()
	{
		Recipient = RNONE;
		theMessage = 0;

	//parameterized constructor!
